# Web Technologies Lab – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of **20 web development programs** created as part of my **Web Technologies / Front-End Development lab work**.  
The objective of this repository is to practice and demonstrate core concepts of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and basic deployment using GitHub Pages or Netlify**.

All programs are implemented step-by-step with a focus on clarity, correctness, and learning fundamentals.

---

##  Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6 basics)  
- Git & GitHub  
- GitHub Pages / Netlify

##  List of Programs Implemented

1. Basic HTML webpage using headings, paragraphs, and text formatting tags  
2. Webpage demonstrating HTML links, images, and lists (ordered, unordered, nested)  
3. Table-based layout using merged cells, alignment, and caption  
4. HTML form with text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, select menu, submit & reset  
5. Structured webpage using semantic elements (`article`, `section`, `nav`, `aside`, `footer`)  
6. Applying Inline, Internal, and External CSS  
7. Advanced CSS styling using Box Model, borders, margins, padding, and background images  
8. CSS selectors: class, id, descendant, group, and universal selectors  
9. Responsive webpage using media queries and mobile-first design  
10. Layout design using `div` and `span` with CSS styling  

11. JavaScript program for basic arithmetic operations using user input  
12. JavaScript conditional statements and looping (`for`, `while`, `do…while`)  
13. User-defined JavaScript functions with `var`, `let`, and `const` scope demonstration  
14. Form validation using JavaScript events (`onsubmit`, `oninput`) and `alert()`  
15. DOM manipulation using `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `innerHTML`  
16. Show/Hide elements using JavaScript and dynamic CSS class toggling  
17. Event handling using `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()`  
18. Creating and manipulating DOM elements using `append`, `remove`, and child nodes  
19. Canvas drawing using `<canvas>` element (shapes and colors)  

20. Git repository initialization, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and deploying a personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages or Netlify

##  Deployment
The personal portfolio website created in this repository has been successfully deployed using:
- **GitHub Pages / Netlify**

This helped me understand real-world workflow including version control and live hosting.

##  Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of HTML structure and semantics  
- Practical use of CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness  
- Hands-on experience with JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation  
- Familiarity with Git, GitHub, and deployment workflows
