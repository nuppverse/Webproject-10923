# Web Technologies Lab – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of **20 web development programs** created as part of my **Web Technologies / Front-End Development lab work**.  
The objective of this repository is to practice and demonstrate core concepts of **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and basic deployment using GitHub Pages or Netlify**.

All programs are implemented step-by-step with a focus on clarity, correctness, and learning fundamentals.

13. User-defined JavaScript functions with `var`, `let`, and `const` scope demonstration  
14. Form validation using JavaScript events (`onsubmit`, `oninput`) and `alert()`  
15. DOM manipulation using `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`, and `innerHTML`  
16. Show/Hide elements using JavaScript and dynamic CSS class toggling  
17. Event handling using `addEventListener()` and `removeEventListener()`  
18. Creating and manipulating DOM elements using `append`, `remove`, and child nodes  
19. Canvas drawing using `<canvas>` element (shapes and colors)  
20. Git repository initialization, committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and deploying a personal portfolio website using GitHub Pages or Netlify

## Practical Assignment 01 – HTML Basics
1. HTML page with an image that redirects to the university website on click
2. Student record table with Roll No, Name, Course, Marks, and Grade
3. HTML form with Name, Email, Gender, Subject dropdown, and Comments
4. Navigation bar using unordered list (Home, About, Courses, Contact)
5. Webpage embedding audio (mp3) and video (mp4) with controls

## Practical Assignment 02 – CSS, Flexbox & Media Queries
1. Demonstration of CSS Box Model and display: inline-block
2. Flexbox layout with three boxes (A, B, C) using justify-content
3. Responsive layout using media queries (column layout below 600px)
4. Styled input field with transition and focus effects

## Practical Assignment 03 – JavaScript Array Operations
1. Count even and odd numbers in an array
2. Remove duplicate values from an array
3. Find the sum of all elements in an array

## Practical Assignment 04 – JavaScript ES6 & DOM Manipulation
1. Arrow function to check if a number is even
2. Multiline string using template literals
3. Merge two arrays using the spread operator
4. Button click event to change paragraph text

## Practical Assignment 05 – Netlify Deployment
Steps followed to deploy a project using Netlify:

1. Created a Netlify account using email/GitHub login
2. Logged in to the Netlify dashboard
3. Selected “Add new site” → “Deploy manually”
4. Uploaded the project folder containing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
5. Successfully deployed the project and obtained a live URL




This helped me understand real-world workflow including version control and live hosting.
